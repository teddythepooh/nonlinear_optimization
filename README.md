## Spectral Clustering

Clustering algorithms are expanding our music libraries one similar song at a time. Music streaming services, such as Spotify and Apple Music, create personalized playlists based on our listening history. These recommendation systems play a critical role in helping listeners discover new musicâ€”and they are made possible by machine learning. Clustering is a widely used machine learning algorithm that partitions data into groups with similar features. Our project explores audio features that are "similar" between different songs through spectral clustering: a dimensionality reduction algorithm that often outperforms classical clustering methods (e.g., k-means). In this presentation, we will provide an overview of spectral clustering and derive its underlying optimization problem. Then, we will utilize a sample of over 3000 songs from Spotify to form clusters that can serve as a basis for generating new playlists among Spotify listeners. Our results will display the interconnectivity of musical genres, as well as highlight the challenges of clustering songs using audio features.
