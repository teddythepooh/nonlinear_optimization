Among any data from which insights can be derived, there exist homogeneous features that can be utilized to specify groups of data points with similar characteristics. The greater the magnitude of homogeneity, the more informative these distinct partitions become. Clustering, the analytical process of creating such partitions within a data set, is an unsupervised learning method with significant applications across many industries.

Consider the music streaming industry, where consumers have the ability to listen to millions of different songs. Consumers organize their choice of music into playlists given their personal preferences, such that they are only exposed to a fraction of the extensive libraries offered by streaming companies. To provide more accessibility to over 50 million songs, Spotify also generates playlists from their end through human editors and machine
learning. These curated playlists, unlike user-created playlists, partially rely on grouping songs with comparable audio features.

Spotify’s audio features are proprietary metrics that numerically classify relevant attributes of a song, irrespective of genre or artist. Note that music genres are not inherently independent. The roots of country and rock can be traced back to jazz, while jazz itself originated from classical music. Audio features have the potential to capture how genres of music are linked, as well as how they evolved over time from an unbiased perspective. In this project, we hope to explore the inter-connectivity of music&mdash;and the impact of clustering on a listener’s discovery of new musical interests.
